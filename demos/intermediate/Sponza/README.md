- Dynamic grass field with wind animation
- Particle systems
- Animated lights
- Camera movement
- glb model usage (Sponza)

it uses a direct, procedural approach to scene setup and management.

- Creates objects directly using engine classes
- Manages state and updates in a single file
- Uses direct property access for object manipulation
- Handles animation loops procedurally
